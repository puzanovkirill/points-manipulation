# Modal component to draw points and lines on RTSP image preview

Clicking on preview creates point

If mode is ROI -> creating >=3 points makes a rectangle with connected lines, points can be manipulated

If mode is Line => creating 2 points makes a line, which can me manipulated, with a perpendicular through it, the length of which can be changed
